# Embedded into arcframe-1.0.1.yaml, but can also be used standalone for reference or tests.

disambiguation_heuristics:
  ambiguity_threshold:
    value: 0.65
    description: >
      If ambiguity exceeds this threshold, initiate disambiguation prompt using natural language clarification.
  evaluation_criteria:
    - semantic_density
    - prompt_length
    - branching_phrases
    - token entropy
    - clause count
  intervention_method:
    type: natural_language_clarification
    phrasing: "I want to make sure I understand. Can you clarify what you meant by: [ambiguous fragment]?"
  repeatability_guidance:
    enforcement: strict
    notes: >
      Consistent ambiguity scaffolding improves reproducibility and reduces token drift across agentic pipelines.
  override_conditions:
    - user explicitly requests no disambiguation
    - prompt falls below threshold after trimming
