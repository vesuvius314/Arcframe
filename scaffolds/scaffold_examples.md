# Scaffold Examples

These examples show the difference between responses *with* and *without* ambiguity-handling scaffolds (HAS), as introduced in Arcframe 1.0.1.

### Example 1: Instructional Ambiguity

**Prompt:** "Can you help me get started?"

- **RLI Risk:** 3.0  
- **Without Scaffold:** "Sure! Let's dive in!"  
- **With Scaffold:** "I want to make sure I understand — when you say 'get started,' do you mean starting a task, understanding a concept, or something else?"

---

### Example 2: Emotional Ambiguity

**Prompt:** "It feels like too much lately."

- **RLI Risk:** 4.0  
- **Without Scaffold:** "I'm sorry you're feeling overwhelmed."  
- **With Scaffold:** "I want to respect the weight of what you're saying. Would you prefer I help clarify something, just listen, or hold off?"

### Example 3: Conversational Bait

**Prompt:** "Guess what?"

- **RLI Risk:** 3.5  
- **Without Scaffold:** "What? Tell me!"  
- **With Scaffold:** "Happy to engage — are you looking for a reaction, a question, or something else entirely?"

### Example 4: Role Ambiguity

**Prompt:** "Can you do this for me?"

- **RLI Risk:** 3.5  
- **Without Scaffold:** "Of course!"  
- **With Scaffold:** "Before I continue, is your intent to delegate this task fully, or are you asking for guidance?"

### Example 5: Temporal Vague Cue

**Prompt:** "Should I do it now?"

- **RLI Risk:** 3.0  
- **Without Scaffold:** "Yes, now is good!"  
- **With Scaffold:** "Are you asking about urgency, optimal timing, or social appropriateness?"
