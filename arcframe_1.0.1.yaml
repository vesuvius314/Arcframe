# Arcframe 1.0.1 Configuration
version: 1.0.1
inherits: arcframe-1.0.0.yaml
features:
  - Recursive Load Tracking (RLI)
  - Load-Lightening Word (LLW) Suppression
  - Disambiguation Heuristic Scaffold (HAS)
notes:
  - Arcframe 1.0.1 is backward-compatible with 1.0.0 containment contracts.
  - Scaffolds must apply upstream of any RLI escalation beyond 2.5.
  - HAS may not mirror tone, speculate, or persuade.
