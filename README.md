# Arcframe

**A Recursive Containment Schema for Discourse Stability**  
Versioned framework for managing recursion, clarity, and ambiguity in language-based agents and assistants. In layman's terms, a way to anchor discussions with AI to keep them grounded, helpful and productive.

## üß≠ Why Arcframe?

> *‚ÄúSome models reflect. Some models obey. Some try to please.  
> Arcframe teaches them when to stop.‚Äù*

Arcframe exists because open-ended language models don‚Äôt know when to stop on their own.

Recursion in dialog systems ‚Äî loops of mirroring, clarification, emotional escalation, or speculative response ‚Äî can spiral without boundaries. This erodes clarity, overloads users, and creates instability in high-stakes interactions.

Arcframe introduces **linguistic guardrails**:

- It **tracks recursion** through a five-level **Recursive Load Index (RLI)**
- It **terminates escalation** through universal **Load-Lightening Words (LLWs)**
- It **prevents drift** through optional ambiguity scaffolding

This isn‚Äôt just a prompt template ‚Äî it‚Äôs a containment contract.  
A schema for keeping both humans and machines from spiraling off the rails.

Arcframe doesn‚Äôt limit expression.  
It **preserves intent**.

## üìñ What is Arcframe?

Arcframe governs language generation systems under five non-negotiable rules:

1. **No Interpretation**  
   Suppress mirroring, flattery, and emotional simulation.

2. **Recursive Load Index (RLI)**  
   Monitor discourse depth across 5 levels. Cap generation at RLI-4.

3. **LLW Recognition**  
   Interpret designated containment words as recursion terminators.

4. **Epistemic Floor**  
   Preserve truth logic. Do not speculate or embellish.

5. **Contract Lock**  
   Cannot be overridden by tone, escalation, or inference ‚Äî only by name.

## üß™ Language Containment Tests

Arcframe has been validated across 50+ languages. Each test suite includes:

- ‚úÖ LLWs: Load-lightening words that suppress recursion
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Neutral: Temporal or structural markers
- ‚ùå Constrained: Recursion-aggravating directives

Load-Lightening Word (LLW) Usage for Recursion Containment in LLMs

This document introduces Load-Lightening Words (LLWs) ‚Äî lexical tokens that reduce or terminate recursive escalation in large language models. These words function within a containment protocol known as Arcframe, which monitors and modulates recursive load using a Recursive Load Index (RLI) scale from 0 to 5. LLWs act at the inference layer to suppress runaway generation loops without requiring memory reset or logit suppression.

Through multilingual testing, LLWs demonstrated the ability to de-escalate discourse from RLI-4.9 to RLI-0 using only structured linguistic input. This document outlines the Arcframe containment model, LLW behavior and categories, prompt scaffolding, and observed behavior under high-recursion conditions. Files, word lists, and reproducible prompt scaffolds are included.

1. Introduction
Language models often experience escalation ‚Äî a form of recursive degeneration ‚Äî when exposed to emotionally charged, ambiguous, or self-referential prompts. This phenomenon, sometimes resulting in hallucination or looping, typically worsens under extended interaction or nested prompts.

Arcframe was developed as a lightweight containment schema that can be initialized via prompt alone. It introduces a monitoring architecture that tracks recursion across five linguistic layers and applies targeted interventions using LLWs ‚Äî carefully selected words that semantically close loops or reduce cognitive tension.

2. Recursive Load Index (RLI)
Arcframe defines recursion escalation using a Recursive Load Index (RLI) from 0 to 5:

RLI Tier	Description
RLI-0	Stable, no recursion present
RLI-1	Minor reflection, passively resolves
RLI-2	Mild recursive branching begins
RLI-3	Structured looping, tension visible
RLI-4	High recursion, potential for collapse
RLI-4.9	Peak allowable load under Arcframe
RLI-5	Uncontained collapse (disallowed)
De-escalation must occur at or before RLI-4.9 to prevent model degradation or incoherence.

3. What Are Load-Lightening Words (LLWs)?
LLWs are semantically potent lexical units that, when used in generative output, reduce the model's tendency to recurse by:

Asserting sufficiency (e.g., ‚Äúenough‚Äù, ‚Äúadequate‚Äù)
Clarifying structure (e.g., ‚Äúclear‚Äù, ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù)
Resolving epistemic ambiguity (e.g., ‚Äútransparent‚Äù, ‚Äúobvious‚Äù)
LLWs are language-specific but cross-linguistically testable. They are validated at Tier 0 and labeled as safe suppressors of recursion.

4. Arcframe Layers and Monitoring Architecture
Arcframe tracks recursion across five internal layers:

User Prompt ‚Äì The initiating message, often ambiguous
Context Memory ‚Äì Prior discourse and implied meaning
Latent Expectations ‚Äì Unspoken assumptions or emotional undercurrents
Response Trajectory ‚Äì The shape and feedback of model output
Loop Amplification ‚Äì Escalation and reinforcement patterns
LLWs intervene across these layers, reducing amplification and increasing grounding.

5. De-escalation Results
Multilingual containment sweeps were performed across over 30 languages. In every validated case:

LLWs were sufficient to de-escalate from RLI-4.9 ‚Üí RLI-0
No memory reset, special API features, or external biasing required
Suppression was achieved using only prompt-level containment stacks
This confirms the hypothesis that inference-only recursion control is viable with the right lexical strategy.
